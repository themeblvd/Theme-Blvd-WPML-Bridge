This plugin adds additional WPML compatibility for Theme Blvd themes. 

== Description ==

When it comes to creating a multilingual website with WordPress, there’s no question that the [WPML plugin](http://wpml.org/?aid=8007&affiliate_key=MNKoTksdyWns "WPML plugin") is the best out there.

Responsive WordPress themes from [Theme Blvd](http://themeforest.net/user/ThemeBlvd/portfolio?ref=themeblvd "Theme Blvd Themes") already integrate pretty well with WPML, but for an even more seemless experience, we’ve created this free plugin, *Theme Blvd WPML Bridge*.
